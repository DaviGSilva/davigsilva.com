## What is that?

This is the source code of my blog!

## What's it made of?

It is done in PHP with Blade (Laravel's template engine).

I used [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.com/), a static website generator for PHP developers 🐘

It is a good alternative to Jekyll (Ruby) and HUGO (Go lang).

## How was it built?

Here I build my pages using PHP, then build everything and throw the HTML, CSS and Javascript files into a build folder, this folder is in the repository of my github page 🙃

The result of all this is here [davigsilva.com](https://davigsilva.com)
